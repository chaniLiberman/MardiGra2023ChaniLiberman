                        landed near present-day

                        in the decaded that followed ,New orleans and other French settlements began marking the holiday

                        ,masked balls and lavish dinners ,When the Spanish took control of New Orleans ,however ,they
                        abolished these rowday

                        On Mardi Gras in 1827, a group of students donned colorful costumes and danced through the
                        streets of New Orleans
                        ,emulating the revelry they'd observed while visiting Paris , Ten years later ,the first
                        recorded New Orleans Gras
                        parade took place , a tradition that continues to this day.

                        In 1857, a secret society of New Orleans businessmen called the Mistick Krewe of Comus organized
                        a torch-lit Mardi Gras
                        procession with marching bands and rolling floats ,setting the tone for future public
                        celebrations in the city.

                        Mardi Gras is so much more special when you understand what you're
                        celebrating and what each tradition means to the
                        generations of parade-goers who have stood on parade toutes before you. There is a story and a
                        purpose behind everything
                        you'll experience during Carenival Time - from the king cake you'll eat to the flambeaux who
                        light the parades at night.

                        costumes and throws, according to Mardi Gras New Orleans, They are individually funded by

                    <h6 class="title">What is Mardi Gras?</h6>
                    Mardi Gras is a tradition that dates back thousands of years to pagan celebrations of spring and
                    fertility , including
                    the raucous Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Lupercalia.
                    By the late 1930s, New Orleans had street parades of nails with carriages and horse riders to
                    celebrate Mardi Gras.
                    Dazzling gas torches, or "flambs", lit the way for the krava members and gave every event an
                    exciting atmosphere of
                    romance and festivity. In 1856, six mobile Native youths formed the Mystic Krewe of Comus, inviting
                    John Milton's hero
                    Comus to represent their organization. Comos brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
                    floats (known as
                    tableau cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remain anonymous.

                    In 1870, the second Krewe of Mardi Gras, the Twelfth Night Celebrants, was formed. This is also the
                    first recorded
                    account of Mardi Gras "shots".

                    <h6 class="title">When is Mardi Gras?</h6>
                    Mardi Gras is traditionally celebrated on "Fat Tuesday", the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday and the
                    start of Lent. In many
                    areas, however, Mardi Gras has evolved into a week-long festival
